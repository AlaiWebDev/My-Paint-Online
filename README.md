Hi folks !
Thanks for your interest.

That repo is dedicated to a challenge i started during my training to become Mobile web developer.
The goal is to create an online clone version of Paint Windws 10 application.

I'll use only HTML/CSS/JS languages.

I'll work to get as much as possible utilities we can find on Paint application.
I guess i'll update that project with differents versions regarding skills i'll add to my pool.

I hope u'll enjoy my work.

Best regrads,

Alain ORLUK.
